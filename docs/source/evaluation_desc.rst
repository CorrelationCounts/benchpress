There is typically no algorithm which performs well with respect to all performance metrics, and no single metric which is generally preferred. 
Therefore, to get an overall picture of the performance of an algorithm Benchpress supports different metrics through the modules in this section.
The output of the modules are copied to *results/output* for easy access.
